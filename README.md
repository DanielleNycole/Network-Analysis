<h2>Description</h2>
This is a collection of the projects and reports I've done for Network Analysis

<br />

<h2>Reports</h2>

- <b> [Analyze Network Layer Communication](https://github.com/DanielleNycole/Network-Analysis/blob/main/Network%20Layer%20Communication%20(1).pdf) </b> | I analyzed DNS and ICMP traffic logs on a fictional website that was reported to be down. The goal was to identify if there was malicious traffic on a network.

- <b> [Analyze Network Attacks](https://github.com/DanielleNycole/Network-Analysis/blob/main/Network%20Attacks.pdf) </b> |  I identified the cause of a service interruption when accessing the companyâ€™s website. In my report, I have explained how the attack happened, and the impact from it.

- <b> [OS Hardening Analysis](https://github.com/DanielleNycole/Network-Analysis/blob/main/OS%20Hardening%20.pdf) </b> |  I investigated, identified, documented and wrote up a solution for a website that was having security issues when loading the main webpage

- <b> [Network Hardening Analysis](https://github.com/DanielleNycole/Network-Analysis/blob/main/Network%20Hardening.pdf) </b> |  I assessed a data breach for a social media organization. I identified common network hardening tools for the organization to implement. I wrote a report to explain to the company how these methods and tools can assist with managing their vulnerability and prevent future incidents

- <b> [Use the NIST Framework to respond to an incident](https://github.com/DanielleNycole/Network-Analysis](https://github.com/DanielleNycole/Network-Analysis/blob/main/NIST%20Incident%20report%20analysis.pdf)https://github.com/DanielleNycole/Network-Analysis/blob/main/NIST%20Incident%20report%20analysis.pdf)</b>  In this report, I reviewed a security event, and used the NIST Framework the analyze the incident
