<h2>Description</h2>
This is a collection of the projects and reports I've done for Network Analysis

<h2>Reports</h2>

- <b> [Network Hardening Analysis](https://github.com/DanielleNycole/Network-Analysis) </b> |  I assessed a data breach for a social media organization. I identified common network hardening tools for the organization to implement. I wrote a report to explain to the company how these methods and tools can assist with managing their vulnerability and prevent future incidents
